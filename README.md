# Genome-wide annotation on functional Branchpoints in human genome
## Introduction
We developed an ensemble-based deep learning framework (**DeepEnsemble**) to predict intronic branchpoints, essential for RNA splicing, in the human genome. The model integrates sequence features and genomic distances to identify branchpoints within 70-nucleotide regions upstream of 3' splice sites. Additionally, we prioritized [ClinVar](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/intro/) branchpoint variants and extended the framework to quantify the effects of SNVs on branchpoint functionality.
